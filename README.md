# University Database Model - DAMG 6210

## Addressing Business Problems

The goal of this database is to reduce the data redundancy and improve data consistency by merging all the databases and data descriptions(metadata) into one central repository. For Example, in a university, departments have their own isolated databases, which is just catering to their own needs. If personnel from administration needs to access the information on a student, they need to login into a department specific database and retrieve the information. In another scenario, if a student from an IT department wishes to opt for a course from the Journalism department, the administration will register a separate student record in the Journalism department. This will lead to data redundancy as the database in the Journalism department may hold the same metadata as the IT department. If a student needs to update his phone number or address, he needs to reach out to both the departments to ensure data consistency. This is one of the major objectives we are trying to resolve in this project. We are also trying to address few more business problems in a University Database Model:
1.	Using a centralized database to track overall studentâ€™s academic performance regardless of the department they belong to and determine the list of students with lower grades. This will help the University and the Professors to focus more on these students and look at ways to assist them.
2.	Determine the number of courses handled by Professors and ensure that sections per course is evenly split between Professors. Also, determine the number of sections required based on course registrations.
3.	Making course registration easier. Suppose a student wants to opt for a course from a different department, he can do so by accessing the course registration system which is in sync with the central database.
4.	Making sure each student is assigned an advisor. Having a centralized database, gives the student flexibility to choose an Academic Advisor (from any Department) or a counsellor they are comfortable with.
